== Description ==

http://www.atbar.org


ATbar is a cross browser accessibility toolbar which can be added to a user's browser or alternatively, for developers, the toolbar launcher can be embedded on a website.

The ATbar offers a collection of user preferences for interacting with websites such as text enlargement, increased line spacing, font, style and size changes with the options of different background colours and accessible webpages (Wordpress is accessible). There is an option to use a dictionary, text-to-speech and spell checking.

Developed by the ECS Accessibility Team at the University of Southampton.

= Known Issues =

When the toolbar loads it does not load the funtions, only the toolbar image. This is being addressed in a new version of the toolbar called ATkit. Once complete it will semlessly replace the toolbar loaded from this plugin.

This plugin does not contain the toolbar, only the means to load it.
