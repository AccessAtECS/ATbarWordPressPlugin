ATbar is a cross browser accessibility toolbar which can be added to a user's browser or alternatively, for developers, the toolbar launcher can be embedded on a website. The toolbar is available in both English and Arabic.

The ATbar offers a collection of user preferences for interacting with websites such as text enlargement, increased line spacing, font, style and size changes with the options of different background colours and accessible webpages (Wordpress is accessible). There is an option to use a dictionary, text-to-speech and spell checking.

If you wish to create your own version of the toolbar with different features, go to http://marketplace.atbar.org. You can then you the toolbar for your personal browsing or add it to this plugin for use on your WordPress site.
